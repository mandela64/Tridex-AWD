# Tridex-AWD

Goal is to add AWD to the Voron Tridex.

Purchased parts:
- Common Anomaly X Beam
- Ldo Nema 14 2A S35 (X-Axis)
- Vitalii3D Metal Voron Tap (2)

Printed parts:
- X axis is based on aTinyShellScript AWD mod. 
- Y axis motor mount and gantry bracket is my design with a front tensioner inspired by clee BZI tensioner.
- MetalTap adapters allow 6mm belts to pass behind toolheads.

* Y-Axis front tensioner requires additional z-height. I am currently using the Mandala Rose Work matched height kinematic kit.
